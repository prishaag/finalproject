                <h3> StoryGen</h3>
                <p> StoryGen was created with a team of 4 during the MHacks Hackathon. StoryGen is an interactive learning app designed to help children improve their reading skills by allowing them to generate and engage with stories of their choice. Harnessing the power of ChatGPT, StoryGen enables children to create stories tailored to their reading level and interests, allowing them to learn at an accelerated rate.  </p>

                <h3> Ping Pong</h3>
                <p> I coded this ping pong game as a Python learning project, aiming to enhance my skills. In this virtual match, two players control paddles to score points until one hits the winning score, initially set at 10. The game boasts a user-friendly interface with responsive controls, dynamic ball action, and a clear score display. After each match, a swift victory announcement and reset feature ensure a seamless gaming experience.

                <h3> Music Analysis</h3>
                <p> I coded this project with a group as a final project for my data-oriented programming class. This project integrates the Billboard Top 100, Spotify, and Youtube API's to deliver a holistic view of today's music charts.  Reshuffling the charts, this project transforms raw data into captivating visualizations. This project is still a work in progress, so the code will be available soon. </p>
