                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Music is a big part of my life- I always have headphones in. I love curating spotify playlists (I have over 20). Currently my favorite song is Now That We Don't Talk by Taylor Swift.</p>

                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>I really like to eat. I like to eat basically everything. Well not everything, because I am a vegetarian, but everything I CAN eat. Except for spinach. My favorite food currently is ramen.</p>

                <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>I like to stay pretty active- I was a competitive swimmer, ice skater, cross-country-er and skiier for most of my life. Now, I don't have time to do all those, but I still love to run .</p>
